## üéØ Motivation

Many Android TV set-top boxes or custom builds lack a persistent, always-visible clock or status bar. Cornerlays solves this problem by providing simple, stable, and highly configurable information widgets that integrate seamlessly into your screen.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/olus85/Cornerlays/releases) on GitHub.
2.  Download the latest `Cornerlays.apk` file.
3.  Sideload the APK file onto your Android TV or device and install it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1.  Open the **Cornerlays** app from your device's app launcher.
2.  Use the tabs at the top to switch between Clock, Date, Weather, and **HA** settings.
3.  Enable the widgets you want to see and customize them to your liking.
4.  **For Home Assistant:**
      * Navigate to the **HA** tab.
      * Enter your Home Assistant URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8123`) and a Long-Lived Access Token.
      * Click one of the "HA-Overlay" slots to configure it. Use the entity picker to select a sensor and adjust its appearance.
5.  **To fine-tune the position:**
      * Navigate to the "Fine-Tune Position" button and press OK.
